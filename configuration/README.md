# Sample Configuration

This are some parts of my V2 300 configurations describing all the mag-probe, probing
and QGL stuff.

If you use Z-Tilt instead of QGL, you can replace the `QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL` macro with the
`Z_TILT_ADJUST` macro from the `z_tilt.cfg` file.

These configurations are the essence of the overall configuration from
[zellneralex](https://github.com/zellneralex/klipper_config/tree/master)
which is really well done !! Have a look if you want to take all of it!

*As an alternative: You may only use the macros from Klicky probe and configure
the `[z_calibration]` section.*

**CAUTION: Please, don't just copy it - these are only examples! Understand and adapt
for your needs instead! Use this on your own risk!**
